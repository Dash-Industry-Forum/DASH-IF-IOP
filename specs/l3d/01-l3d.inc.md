## Introduction ## {#l3d:introduction}

This feature description is an update to DASH-IF Low-Latency extensions [[!IOP5-PART4-LL]] adding additional features.

## Scenarios and Motivation ## {#l3d:scenarios}

In 2017, [[DVB]](https://www.dvb.org) and [[DASH-IF]](https://www.dashif.org) started to collaborate to address 
Low-Latency DASH-based services. Initially, a joint group was formed that developed a report that was issued 
by DVB/DASH-IF as _DASH-IF/DVB Report on Low-Latency Live Service with DASH_ [[!LL-REPORT]].

* Reviewing the Report - what has changed
    * Do have new requirements in terms of latency &lt; 3 seconds?
        * There are new requirements that sports events may needed less than 3 seconds, but not that hard
        * We have the report here: [https://dashif.org/webRTC/report](https://dashif.org/webRTC/report)
            * Betting use case may be of relevance.
            * Please check if any of the use case matter as is or in variants for the work we are planning top
    * Do we have new requirements to tune and switching?
        * faster tune-in, time to first video is very important and should be low (1-2 seconds may be too high)
        * Start playback faster – do not wait for up to 2 seconds
        * Faster switching to avoid buffering
        * Independency of joining latency, switching latency and segment duration
    * Do we have new requirements for efficiency?
        * _Compression efficiency_
        * _Enables scene-boundary aligned segments_
        * _Mini-GOP-sized partial segments for random access and events_
    * Are there any new use cases that requires new technology?
        * Ad insertion w/o stream conditioning
            * Return from ad break to an arbitrary place – not necessarily an IDR
        * LL-HLS compatibility
            * Reuse LL-HLS partial segments
            * Use DASH templates to keep same MPD update efficiency
        * Trick modes
            * Small partial segments can be used for smoother trick play
    * Did the defined technology for LL-DASH not meet the requirements?
        * The technology may meet the requirements in terms of latency, but at the expense of reduced quality, including more re-buffering and/or reduced compression efficiency
        * Today's technology typically requires that segment durations are in the range of 2 seconds. 
* Next Steps
    * add the above logic to the introduction of the feature.
    * Start documenting the technology by reference to 6th edition
    * also document client requirements
